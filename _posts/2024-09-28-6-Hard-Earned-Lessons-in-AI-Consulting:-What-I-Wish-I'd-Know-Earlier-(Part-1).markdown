Whether you're leading an AI team or managing AI projects, you've probably faced the challenge of connecting AI models to real business value. In my early days as an AI consultant, I learned some tough lessons that aren't in textbooks or courses. For anyone responsible for guiding AI projects, handling client expectations, and delivering results, here are six hard-earned lessons that can help you avoid common pitfalls and make your AI initiatives more effective from the start.

## Manage Client's Expectations or Pay the Price
I once worked with a major oil and gas company where the project scope kept shifting. The goal was to enhance oil recovery using hydraulic fracturing data. The client continually changed requirements, and I failed to document and manage these changes. The result? Misaligned expectations and a strained relationship.

Now, I handle scope changes and feature requests like code pull requests: each one is logged, timestamped, and agreed upon. This keeps expectations aligned and protects both parties from scope creep.

## Speak Client's Language
I built a model perfectly tailored to a client's needs, but they didn't see its value. I realized that if the client doesn't understand the benefits, it's not just their problem—it's mine too. As an AI consultant, my role isn't just to build models but also to translate AI concepts into real business value.

Since then, I assess the client's understanding of AI from day one. I tailor my explanations to their level of knowledge and focus on how the solution practically benefits their business. This ensures clients grasp the value, leading to better buy-in from stakeholders. Effective communication is about making the information resonate with the client and their team.

## Hold the Line
In an early project, I delivered a model that conflicted with expected data trends and didn't effectively communicate these deviations. I let the client's skepticism shake my confidence—a big mistake.
From this moment forward, the client then started requesting numerous ad-hoc analyses based on their own hypotheses, adding no real value. This shifted the dynamic, turning the client into an informal project manager with significant influence but no accountability for deliverables, leaving me to handle the fallout. It was a tough lesson for me as I wasn't able to recover from my role jack-of-all-trades assistant during this project. 

I learned the hard way that as an AI consultant, I must bridge the gap between data insights and domain expectations, even when the findings are unexpected. It’s crucial to stand by the results and clearly communicate their implications, rather than letting the client’s doubts dictate the project direction. This experience taught me the importance of maintaining confidence in my expertise, regardless of industry-specific knowledge gaps. Now, I assertively present data-driven insights and ensure that the project remains focused on actionable outcomes, not just chasing client-driven assumptions. 

Remember, you're not just a code monkey; you're bringing fresh perspectives through data interpretation. To be continued in Part 2...
